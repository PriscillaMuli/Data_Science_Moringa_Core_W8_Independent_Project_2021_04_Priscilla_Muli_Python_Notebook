**Classification on a Health Dataset**

**Description**

A Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. The data was to be then used to build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroidism.

**Platforms Used**

Google Colab

Git/GitHub

**Technologies Used**

Python

Pandas Library

Numpy Library

Matplotlib Library

Seaborn Library

Standard Library

SciPy Library

Sci-Kit Library

xgboost

catboost

**Motivation**

The aim was to try and come up with an accurate and also precise model to classify if a patient had hypothyroid or not. Given the burden that the healthcare sector faces in terms of under-staffing and also long working hours, it would be of immense help if some of the load was reduced such as a form of pre-screening before needing the doctors to step in. Resulting in freeing up resources to focus on urgent and life threatening cases. For the model, Decision Trees(Random Trees, AdaBoosted and XGBoosted trees) were all tested including SVM(linear, Polynomial and RBF Kernels) to get the best performing one.
